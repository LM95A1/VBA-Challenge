# VBA-Challenge
VBA Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 2.

As requested by the assignment, the VBA code utilized to achieve the results presented in the screenshots is contained in the file named "StockDataFinal.vbs".
Though I had some confusion as to what's required of me when being asked to include "separate VBA files", the one included in this repo is the only one completed. Instead, I will attempt to describe my work process as if it were an Academy Award Speech.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank Professor Irfan for his teachings and the TA for their asssistance. Irfan's patience, along with how he covers material and demonstrates each piece of the topics we cover are paramount to my understanding of class material.
This code was primarily handcrafted by using different notes I was able to take and examples from Irfan's designated activities for VBA days, allowing me to copy certain formulas for loops and just swap out values relating to the project.

Fellow classmates Dustin, Tatiana, and Miggy were essential to my understanding of code syntax and formulaic changes required to effectively produce the desired results as presented in the screenshots. Y'all are the GOATs.

Google and Stack Overflow came in clutch when it came to certain errors and questions that we could not answer due to our brains not fully functioning at 2:45am EDT. It also assisted with shortcuts for certain code blocks (primarily the "with ws" function that I don't think I fully understood in class or we just didn't cover).

Though I can't remember off the top of my head where I got the answers for most errors, the code was primarily written by me in pieces through Visual Studio Code instead of Excel's developer tab as I find Visual Studio Code's interface a lot sexier and better to work with.

This might be going on for too long.
